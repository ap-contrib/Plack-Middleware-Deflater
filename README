          my $app = shift;
          sub {
              my $env = shift;
              delete $env->{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING} if $env->{HTTP_USER_AGENT} =~ m!^Mozilla/4.0[678]!; #Nescape has some problem
              $app->($env);
          }
      };
      enable "Deflater"

          vary_user_agent => 1;

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::Deflater is a middleware to encode your response body
    in gzip or deflate, based on "Accept-Encoding" HTTP request header. It
    would save the bandwidth a little bit but should increase the Plack
    server load, so ideally you should handle this on the frontend reverse
    proxy servers.

    This middleware removes "Content-Length" and streams encoded content,
    which means the server should support HTTP/1.1 chunked response or
    downgrade to HTTP/1.0 and closes the connection.

CONFIGURATIONS
    content_type
          content_type => 'text/html',
          content_type => [ 'text/html', 'text/css', 'text/javascript', 'application/javascript', 'application/x-javascript' ]

        Content-Type header to apply deflater. if content-type is not
        defined, Deflater will try to deflate all contents.

    vary_user_agent
          vary_user_agent => 1

        Add "User-Agent" to Vary header.
